Making Bridget's Resume Website:

1.  Remove parts of header to just have purple background
2.  Change the words on the navbar to be Intro, About Me, Projects, Contact
3.  My Name is above the Line, Then a little one-liner under it. 
	- Link to resume is where Learn More is. Along with Learn more changing to read "Resume"
	- Delete the picture spot entirely
4.  Switch Magna... section with Ipsum conse.... section
5.  Write the About me with the label at the top of it reading "About Me" 
	- The graphic could be used for saying which langs I know and the skills 
		I have along with possibly the profiecency levels each of them have. 
			I.e. -> JavaScript and then under it would say "Intermediate"
	- Remove Learn More Button
6.  2 Projects with the 'Magna' section:
		- It would be cool if you made it clear that the icons above are the button to click on 
			that lead to another page with screenshots and project descriptions
		- Remove Learn More button
	1. Masterclass Moving
	2. CleanSolutionsTechnologies
	
7.  Delete Congue imperdiet Section
8. Contact me is the Footer. [Ensure that the navbar links correctly to the 
	footer since by default it does not]
	- Left side is a form to contact me, Ensure that the form leads to an email I don't care about
		Since bots like to fill out forms. Alternatively you can use a google form and have the google
			form lead to its designated form page. (ask Neil)
	- Right side
		- No address
		- Create new email and put it here (Use this email to do all job stuff)
		- No phone
		-Icons: LinkedIn, GitHub, CodePen
