									<h1>Projects</h1>
									<p>A couple people I know were nice enough to let me get real pracice and create websites for their businesses.
										Both projects were very different, but they are the beginings of what I realized I needed to learn. From researching
										colors and other websites to see what I needed to include.
									</p>
									<p>I hope to learn how to truly bring websites to life, to make people want to visit them again just because how cool it can look!</p>

										<h2>Masterclass Moving</h2>
										<p>A friend of mine had started a moving company and he generously let me create him a website.
									   	I used images and content found on his facebook page and filled in a majority of the rest editing answers from chatGPT.
									    I put a lot of research into other moving companies, from the content of their websites, to colors and images,
								      and especially their design and layouts.</p>
										<p>Over the course of a few months, as I learned more I changed the design three times, each starting basically
										from scratch. Even now, as I continue to learn, I still come up with ideas to make it better.</p>

										<h2>Clean Solutions Technologies</h2>
										<p>Originally, I was asked to convert this website from Squarespace to WordPress. Then I was given free reign
										to try to make it better. As I did with Masterclass Moving, I researched similar websites to get an idea of how
									this could be redesigned. I spent hours looking into web design and figuring out hierarchy, then I came across
								something that said Adobe XD was made for web design. Lucky for me, I already pay for Adobe Creative Cloud and I
							went to youtube to figure out how to better what web design I had been able to figure out. I found that it was a lot of
						fun and much more helpful to piece together content and images to create a website.</p>
